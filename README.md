To-Do List (Python CLI App)

This is a simple command-line To-Do List app built in Python. It allows users to:

    View tasks

    Add new tasks

    Remove tasks

    Mark tasks as complete or incomplete

    Automatically save/load tasks between sessions

All data is stored locally in a text file called tasks.txt using JSON formatting.





How to Run:

 1.   Clone the repo:
    git clone git@github.com:BerryFarm97/todo-list-python.git
    cd todo-list-python

  2.  Run the app:
    python todoList.py

Make sure Python 3 is installed.






File Overview:

todoList.py → Main application code
